Yatin is a Talented student.Afer performing well in class 12, he went for engineering.
It's not that he choose engineering rather engineering choose him.
He needs certain level of motivation just after class 12.
Now he is standing in begining phase of engineering life.
There are many ups and downs in engineering life.

Let's assume the engineering life is divided into some weeks.
Each week may or may not have an event associated with it.
Also the motivation level of yatin reduces by 10 after every week.

The events can be :
Party - represented by 'p' which increases energy level by 100
Watching movie - represented by 'm' which increases energy level by 50
Small outings - represented by 'o' which increases energy level by 80
Internal exams - represented by 'i' which decreases energy level by 100
Externals exams - represented by 'e' which decreases energy level by 200
No event - represented by 'n'

Yatin needs enough motivation level so that he can survive through engineering life.
Yatin is good programmer but he is busy applying to other universities for BTech.
Your task is to help yatin to find out the minimum motivation level required to survive through engineering life.


Input :
First line of input represent the number of testcases T
T lines follows
Each test case has integer n representing number of weeks
Next line contains n characters separated by space, representing the event associated with that week
 
Output :
Print T lines each representing the minimum motivation level of Yatin at start of engineering.

Sample Input
2
5
oipme
6
niipmn

Sample output
120
110

Constraints
1< T <1000
1< n <1000


Explaination :
For Test case 1 :
So taking motivation level 120 at start
At 'o' motivation level increase by 80 making it 120+80=200 but after 'o' decreased by 10 making it 190.
When 'i' is encounter energy level decrease by 100 so 190-100=90.After 'i' decreased by 10 making it 80.
When 'p' is encounter energy level increase by 100 so 80+100=180.After 'p' decreased by 10 making it 170.
When 'm' is encounter energy level increase by 50 so 170+50=220.After 'm' decreased by 10 making it 210.
When 'e' is encounter energy level decrease by 200 so 210-200=10.After 'm' decreased by 10 making it 0.
Thus 120 motivation level of 120 is sufficient for yatin so that he can survive through engineering life.
