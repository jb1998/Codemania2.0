Jatin has some boxes of choco sticks.
He wants to give the choco sticks to his two friends Yatin and Sahil.
Jatin is smart and knows that if Yatin got more choco sticks then Sahil will feel 
bad and if Sahil got more choco sticks then Yatin will feel bad. Jatin decides to 
distribute the choco sticks in a way that both of them gets equal choco sticks.
Jatin also likes maths. So to make the distribution interesting he applied some logic.

He decides that the boxes which have choco sticks in multiples of 7 will all go to a single person.
The boxes that have choco sticks in multiples of 5 (but not of 7) will all go to the another person.
The boxes that have choco sticks which are neither in the multiples of 7 or 5 could go to either of them.

Jatin doesn't want to waste any box.
So all boxes must be consumed.
If it is possible to divide the choco sticks into two equal parts based on the
above conditions then print true else print false. If it's false then Jatin eats all choco sticks alone.




Input:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains 2 lines. Line 1 contains a single integer, N(The number of boxes).
Line 2 contains the number of choco sticks in each of the N boxes separated by space.


Output:
Print T lines each having true or false.
