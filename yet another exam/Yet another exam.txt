Oh it's time for college exams.
The students are sitting in examination hall.
It consists of seats arranged in such a manner that it forms n rows
and m columns

The seats present in hall is manufactured by two companies.
The two companies put their labels on seats.
The labels are in form of single digit 0 or 1
Coincidentally the students that have not studied sit on seats with label 0.
Inorder to pass the exam they need to look up other students answer sheet.

The student sitting on label 0 seat can cheat from student sitting on label 1 seat if
and only if the student is sitting in his neighbour(right,left,front,behind,front-left,front-right,behind-left,behind-right)
Also after cheating the student at label 0 is smart and does not help another student
at label 0.

You are given the configuration of seats in form of 2-D matrix
The matrix has 0s and 1s representing labels of seats.

You need to print the number of students that pass the exam.

Input format  :
The first line contains (T) the number of test cases.
Each test case is followed by two integers m,n representing rows and columns respectively.
m lines follows,each containing n separated integers(0s or 1s)

Output format :
Print T lines each representing the number of students who pass the exam.

sample input
1
3 3
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 0 0

sample output

Explaination :
The three students sitting on seats with labels 0 around the student sitting on label 1 can cheat from that student sitting on label 1 seat
Thus, 4 students pass the exam(the three students sitting on seats with labels 0 and one sitting on label 1)
